Love using your Open Source and Source Available software? Well, it is May 2025
which is the Open Source Initiative's Maintainer Month! Time to give these
neglected but critically important folks a shout out of appreciation. Special
thanks to Nick Vidal for giving the opportunity of this collaboration.

I'm (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho – a maintainer stewarding some fun applications,
some serious tools, and my own legal licenses since 2023. Herein lies my story
about being a growing maintainer.

This article's writing and artworks are strictly human-created with no
Artificial Intelligence's involvement.

## Who Am I

I have been active in software development since 2013 and specialized in
control computing engineering with 2 First-Class Honours Degrees of
Mechatronics Engineering from both Staffordshire University and
Asia Pacific University of Innovation. My works cover projects involving
proprietary licenses, source available licenses, and Open Source licenses
for both non-commercial and commercial goods.

### What's Open Source To Me

It's an open commodity of product and processes (analogous to: standardized
hammer and nails engineering specifications). The main business objective of
Open Source licensing is to make sure everyone can access certain knowledge,
product, or processes without any kind of restrictions including monetary
restrictions. On the contrary, both Source Available and Proprietary licensing
are not free (to change and use) and often associated with monetary charges.
Having said that, we need all software licensing types to make the world whole.
Source Available licensing and Proprietary licensing main business objective is
to make profits. They all need one another to make the world whole.

However, Open Source licenses must not be confused with Source Available
licenses. The latter can get into very nasty business repercussions when
treated that way. For case study, Despite Meta marketed its Llama product as
"Open Source", its license [https://www.llama.com/llama3/license/](https://www.llama.com/llama3/license/) is
actually a Source Available license where they explicitly stated custom
commercial restrictions in §2 instead of the clear freedom offered by
Open Source. Using it like any Open Source license without parsing that
agreement can allow Meta to pursue litigation easily to stop your commercial
pursuit. Always parse the agreement preferably with an attorney.

Therefore, it is important to plan and implement your product with care,
achieving the right protection against your business value and yet ensuring
non-core software components are declared with the right licenses. Here's a
case study: Google primarily profits from digital advertisement so they have
chosen to support various great Open Source products like Android operating
system, Chromium/Chrome web browsers in order to let the general public have
better digital accessibility freely while they can place advertisement lots
for running their business.

### How Do I Got Involved

My first job was to get involved directly with Linux Kernel drivers from the
get-go. That's how I started my journey to Linux and Open Source ecosystems.
After my career advancements, I decided to go all-in into Linux and now Debian
operating system development and have been working in this domain ever since.

Currently, I am collaborating with folks from FireGiant to upgrade my Source
Available automation tool. They provide a MSI packaging solution to my tool
so that it can seamlessly package any product into a professional installer
for Windows operating system without complicated configurations (MSI installer
package is known for its notoriously complicated specifications and executions).

## Communities Management

### Growing Communities

I'm more of the "Laws of Attractions" kind of person for getting people in.
If it solves a business problem, it works seamlessly. I don't actively go
around town trying to force people to use it.

My strategy was to set up a friendly environment for people to come in, have
some fun, exchange business contacts, etc. closely resembling an evening
viking tavern. Folks come in; have some drinks and meals; dance and sing
together to the music; scheduling tomorrow's events together; exchange
experiences and stories; and etc. That's the leadership I want to be in
Open Source.

Since I got my own AutomataCI automation tool, I generally prefer working
with small teams (e.g. 3-4 max) for very effective communications and
end-to-end executions. Wherever there can be automated, it must be automated.

### Project Involved

Personally, for the general public to enjoy playing My AI Image Upscaler (with
no GUI shenanigans):

For legal licensing, I have my own product licenses since year 2024 mainly to
have additional new legal coverages (e.g. data privacy & confidentiality) and
a mix of terms and clauses from multiple licenses to meet my generic
productization needs:

- [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13788522](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13788522)

### Challenges as Maintainers

Very limited resources (as in both time and money). I have many visionary
projects in my backlog but well, I still have to focus on making a living.

My existing communities are good and I love them! I really wish I can provide
them the monetary support they need as a reward for making the world a better
place.

### Message to Contributors

Not all maintainers are jerks, self-indulgent, or egoistic. Please freely speak
out when you're at my "taverns". You can watch Dreamwork's
"How to Train Your Dragons" to understand those emotions, feelings, and
cultures. We'll click eventually. Try to frame your queries with curiosity and
learning: it always works.

Please do not place immediate or deadline bound schedules. Unless you fully
fund the entire project (which can be a huge sum), all of us are actually
contributing via our free and hobby times.

Sometimes we do attempt to align our commercial goals for funding to get
pitched in. Unless we can turn any stone into gold, well, reality strikes hard.

## Security Management

### Key Security Practices

Anything that can be systematically automated, I'll do it at any level –
No one gets left in the dark be it an intern or juniors; not under my wings.

Security design from start (as early as the first working prototype). In
Layman terms, security is a "metal alloy" to be forged from the get-go; not a
"Lego" brick composition to be duct taped with.

OWASP [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) and
IETF [https://datatracker.ietf.org/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/) are my primary go-to for network security.

Kernel Handbook [https://docs.kernel.org/index.html](https://docs.kernel.org/index.html) for Linux Kernel.

Debian Handbook [https://wiki.debian.org/SecurityManagement](https://wiki.debian.org/SecurityManagement) & Specs
[https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/),
[https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format) for Debian OS.

Subscribe to every CVE related messaging and mailing list + Gmail filters for
inbox auto-organizations. Also subscribe to GitHub CVE Security Advisory or CVE
databases.

Comment the Security/Spec reference so the next developer knows where and when
it is implemented (searchable using `grep -R "[KEYWORD]" /path/to/directory`
command).

"Function before Design" principle - Keep the product minimally functional for
minimizing attack surfaces first before starting to apply fancy aesthetics and
display.

### Biggest Security Threat to Open Source

**Threat No.1** is still the deadly supply chain threat. Primarily, I'm
looking at the genuine owners themselves or geo-politics "leaders"
[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6815012](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6815012); not the conventional third-party
attacking "hacking" entities. Just 1 simple question: "if GitHub pulls GitLab's
drastic business policy changes (from `free` to `USD5/user/namespace/month`) or
there is a baseline tariff for network traffic (e.g. from
`~USD0.0025/GB egress only` to `USD2 fees for both ingress and egress`), can one
mitigate such threat oversight?"; This question alone is suffice to cause
enough chaos worldwide. Louis Rossman compiled a lot of toxic business practices
for case studying on his YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/@rossmanngroup/videos>.

**Threat No.2** is the over reliance on the centralized supply repositories
(as in NPM, Python PiP, DockerHub, and Rust's Cargo, and GitHub). If the
Geo-politics of the business unit cuts the supply channels off either altering
business policies "after the fact" or unfriendly incomprehensible foreign
government policy, the entire operation and progress of any ecosystem (Open
Source or otherwise) will be badly stifled.

**Threat No.3** is younger generations tech influencers spoke too loudly with
their too inexperienced "knowledge"; a misguided information. Specialists that
I interacted with rarely speak that loud across the industry. A case study is
this Shell guide from Google
[https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) which completely
decelerates the Shell libraries development. Shell and PowerShell are the best
candidates for general-purpose automation since they can run without installing
anything; not Python that requires its thick interpreter installation;
not Maven with its Java runtime requirement. Another case is its recommended
function name (`mypackage::my_func() { … }`) which is completely not POSIX
compatible and only specific to BASH (I believe the writer is lacking POSIX
shell experiences and came from a C++ domain). This cost me months of complete
libraries rewrite after POSIX realization from cross-running with BSD-based
Operating System.

**Threat No.4** is the usual resources (funding and etc) shortfall. This is as
usual, funding motivates developers to contribute freely. As of this writing,
the Open Source Labs (OSL) from Oregon States University is on life-support
pleading for funding [https://osuosl.org/blog/osl-future/](https://osuosl.org/blog/osl-future/). OSL is
currently providing infrastructure hosting for projects such as Drupal,
Gentoo Linux, Debian, Fedora, phpBB, OpenID, Buildroot/Busybox, Inkscape, Cinc
and many more!

## Artificial Intelligence

### The Good Side

Large Language Model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI) like Claude Sonnet
[https://claude.ai/new](https://claude.ai/new) + Deekseek R1 (https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/) +
Google's Gemini [https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) seriously speed
up the materials searches than conventional manual search engines searches.
I'm referring to this process:

1. Request both AIs to generate a sample or list of some references for manual
   searches; AND
2. Analyze their outputs (codes, list, etc); AND
3. Procure the engineering specifications of the tech; AND
4. Construct your own referencing on those outputs and reading those
   specifications

It also works extremely well with crude language translations (e.g.
English multiple localized → languages across the continents).

Stable Diffusion based AI made the world a lot more colorful and took over dull
image jobs while letting the human artists focus on important artworks
(true story).

Google DeepMind's Udio enables one who has zero experience in music creation but
deeply connected to music listening to finally create his/her desirable music
(true story).

Convoluted Neural Network (CNN) based NCNN Upscaler finally expands GIMP ability
to upscale an image intelligently up to 4x the original per iteration; with
different models. Extremely useful for small-sized image archaeological
recovery (true story).

CNN-based Text to Speech (coming soon) finally allows Debian OS to speak like
human without robotic sounds anymore (true story).

The point: **as long as you create your own version by only referencing it,
then the AI seriously accelerates; be it Open Source, Source Available, or even
Proprietary licenses**.

### The Bad Side

When people misunderstood LLM internal operating functions and misused it for
vibe coding or human replacement (e.g. support services).

> Site-note: good luck to those enterprises!

All conventional search engines are completely unusable due to AI generated
content poisoning. The era of conventional internet search has come to an end.

It's hard and impossible to publish anything on the Internet without getting AI
companies coldbloodily ripping out without respecting local restrictions
(as in `robots.txt`).

AI Porn flooded my social media unwillingly.

Biometrics (e.g. face, voice, fingerprint, and retinas) are getting deep-faked
way too easily – no longer can tell what’s real or not without per-established
"Trust on First Use/Meet" and too easy to lose an actual bona-fide identity.

When people think the current LLM (dating 2025) can replace lawyers (coders of
the real world) and software developers (coders of the virtual world).

License laundering is still an issue where AI generated content can get as
close as the human created version without copyright infringement impact.

### My Views

I personally welcome Artificial Intelligence. They seriously empower me by very
large magnitudes.

It also reveals our economy and finance's biggest problems
"full automation vs. human needs" which is a world economic problem. This is a
main issue everyone is worried about but is currently masked by
Artificial Intelligence as a threat. That's a story for another day.

## To The Future

### To all New Maintainers

Congrats! People care about your products. Keep up the good work.

To the aspiring folks…

- Focus on solving a business problem. You'll attract users without needing to
  roll out a marketing campaign.
- Do not underestimate the "one-time" fun app. It can anytime become a popular
  tool for everyone to use (true story).
- Always differentiate facts and data from individual opinions. Do not waste
  too much time on the latter.
- Engineering specifications and actual documentation are way better than
  "he says she says" stuff by the influencers.

## Epilogue

Thanks for reading thoroughly. Well, we come to an end now.
