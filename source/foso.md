I had my first contact with Open Source development before I even knew how to program. Back then, I used an Open Source instant messaging client called Miranda IM. While looking for help with the client, I discovered a German online community for Miranda [https://miranda-im.de/](https://miranda-im.de/). The people there were helpful and welcoming, and I wanted to give something back to the community. So I started helping other users by answering their questions. Over time, I got involved in localizing some Miranda plugins, doing QA, and writing tutorials. As a teenager, it was a fascinating feeling to know that something I had contributed to was being used by thousands of people.

As a student, I learned how to use Linux as my daily OS. Since it took me multiple attempts and I knew the common problems beginners face, I organized Linux install parties with fellow students to help others avoid the same issues. It was a fun way to grow the Linux community and get more people excited about Open Source tools.

At that time, I also learned how to program and became interested in Android app development. I started blogging about what I was learning on [my website](https://jensklingenberg.de) and shared my code samples on GitHub under an Open Source license. One of the biggest advantages while learning was being able to explore other Open Source projects to see how they tackled similar problems. The fact that Android itself is Open Source makes it even easier to dive into the actual source code and understand how things work under the hood.

The two biggest projects I’m maintaining are:

## Jetpack Compose Playground

“Community-driven collection of Jetpack Compose example code and tutorials“

[https://github.com/Foso/Jetpack-Compose-Playground](https://github.com/Foso/Jetpack-Compose-Playground)

When Google introduced Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs, I was immediately drawn to it. From the moment the first public commits landed, I began experimenting, learning, and sharing what I discovered. I created the Compose Playground as a place to collect practical examples, document insights, and help others get started faster.

Because Jetpack Compose is developed in the open, I could follow its evolution closely and learn directly from the source code. A huge benefit for understanding best practices early on. Over time, more people found the project, contributed examples, and even reached out to say it helped them build their first Compose apps.

## Ktorfit

“HTTP client generator / KSP plugin for Kotlin Multiplatform”

[https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit](https://github.com/Foso/Ktorfit)

Ktorfit started as a personal workaround. I wanted to use Retrofit-style interfaces, but with Ktor and Kotlin Multiplatform. Nothing like it existed at the time, so I built a simple solution for my own needs. Instead of keeping it private, I decided to publish it as an Open Source project.

By sharing it, I opened the door to feedback, contributions, and real-world use cases I never would have thought of on my own. Developers began filing issues, suggesting features, and even submitting pull requests. Now Ktorfit is helping developers around the world, and that’s very rewarding.

One lesson I’ve learned is that you don’t need to release a perfect library to start something valuable. Ktorfit wasn’t perfect when it launched. But through the help of others it gets better with every version.

One of the main challenges I still face as a maintainer is balancing my time between reviewing contributions, answering questions, and working on the code base. It's easy to get overwhelmed, especially when the project gains visibility and more users rely on it. Another challenge is setting clear expectations, making sure people know what kind of contributions are welcome, what the road map looks like, and how to get involved. It can be helpful to have good documentation and contribution guidelines you can link contributors to.

In my eyes, Open Source is a shared effort. It shouldn’t have to rest on one person’s shoulders. The community grows stronger when we support each other. For me, Open Source isn’t just about code, it’s about learning, teaching, and building things together. I’m excited to keep contributing and hopefully inspiring others to start their own journey in Open Source.
Thanks to all people contributing to Open Source, in any kind.
