# maintaine.rs

The **maintaine.rs** book is a curated collection of stories from top **Open Source maintainers**, gathered during [GitHub's Maintainer Month](https://maintainermonth.github.com/) in May 2025.

Each story is written in Markdown and compiled into a beautifully formatted PDF using `pandoc`.
